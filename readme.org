* Introduction

This directory contains a shell script and a C program that
both do the same thing -- compute some checksum-like data
about a file given on the command line.  The C program is more
than 4.5x faster than the script.  Both programs have identical
output on most UNIX platforms.

In addition, a small bash script to drive the checksum program
is in this directory.  As an alternative, one can also use the
super charged version in the dirTravC directory.

* Typical command line use

#+begin_src sh
time ~/csumf.sh * 2>../errorFile.txt | tee ../csumFile.txt
#+end_src
